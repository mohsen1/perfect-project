# [Universal Async Component](https://github.com/mohsen1/universal-async-component-example) Example

## What is this?
[Universal Async Component](https://github.com/mohsen1/universal-async-component) solves the problem of code-splitting and server-side rendering "flash of contents". This is a minimal example of how to use it.

## What's included
* **React Router 4**
* **Hot module replacement for server and client**
* **Code splitting that works in server and client**
* **Automatically generated HTML**
* **TypeScript support**

## Ready to extend

This example is kept minimal to be used as a boilerplate. Adding CSS loader and other trivial stuff is left to you to pick your solutions.

## npm scripts
* `npm start` Start development server
* `npm run build` Build
* `npm build:prod` Build production version
* `npm start:prod` Start production server
